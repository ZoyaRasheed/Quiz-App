## Design

### Colour Scheme

- The app uses a color scheme inspired by geography themes, including:
  - **Background Color**: A world map image for relevance to geography.
  - **Primary Colors**: Shades of blue for buttons and navigation.
  - **Accent Colors**: Green and white for text and highlights.

```css
/* Example colors from app.css */
background-color: #1e3d59;
color: #ffffff;
button {
  background-color: #4caf50;
}
