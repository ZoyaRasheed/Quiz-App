## Design

### Colour Scheme

- The app uses a color scheme inspired by geography themes, including:
  - **Background Color**: A world map image for relevance to geography.
  - **Primary Colors**: Shades of blue for buttons and navigation.
  - **Accent Colors**: Green and white for text and highlights.

---

### Typography

- Fonts Used:
  - **Heading Font**: [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto), a clean and modern sans-serif font.
  - **Body Font**: [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) for readability.
- All fonts were sourced from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

```css
/* Example typography from app.css */
body {
  font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
}
h1, h2, h3 {
  font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
}

```
